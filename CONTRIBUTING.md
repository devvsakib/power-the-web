## Checking Assigned Issues Before Submitting a Pull Request
When contributing to an open-source project, it's important to ensure that your work aligns with the goals of the project and doesn't duplicate efforts. One way to achieve this is by checking if the issue you are addressing has already been assigned to someone else. If an issue is already assigned, it's better to collaborate with the assignee to ensure that everyone is working efficiently towards the same goal.

This can also help to avoid conflicts between multiple contributors and ensure that the review process is conducted by the right people. 
**Pull requests that are not assigned to an issue or don't align with the project goals may be closed to maintain the quality and efficiency of the open-source project.**
