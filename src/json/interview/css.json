    },
    {
        "question": "What is the box model in CSS?",
        "answer": "The box model is a way of representing the layout of elements in CSS. It consists of four parts: the content, padding, border, and margin. The content is the actual content of the element, the padding is the space between the content and the border, the border is the border around the element, and the margin is the space between the border and the surrounding elements.",

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between class and ID selectors in CSS?",
        "answer": "Class selectors are used to apply a style to multiple elements on a page, while ID selectors are used to apply a style to a single unique element. In CSS, class selectors are denoted with a period (.), while ID selectors are denoted with a hash symbol (#).",
        "tag": "css"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between margin and padding in CSS?",
        "answer": "Margin and padding are both CSS properties that define the space around an element, but they have different effects. Margin adds space outside the border of an element and can be used to create space between adjacent elements. Padding adds space inside the border of an element and can be used to create space between the content and the border. Both properties can be specified using shorthand syntax or individual properties for each side (top, right, bottom, left).",
        "tag": "css"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the CSS box-sizing property?",
        "answer": "The box-sizing property in CSS determines how the width and height of an element are calculated. By default, the width and height of an element include the content, padding, and border layers. This can make it difficult to create consistent layouts, especially when using percentages or ems for sizing. The box-sizing property can be set to border-box, which makes the width and height include the padding and border layers, or content-box, which is the default behavior.",
        "tag": "css"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the CSS float property, and how does it work?",
        "answer": "The float property in CSS is used to align an element to the left or right of its container. When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document and can overlap with other elements. This can be useful for creating multi-column layouts or wrapping text around an image. However, it can also cause layout problems if not used carefully. The clear property can be used to prevent elements from overlapping with floated elements.",
        "tag": "css"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between position: absolute and position: relative in CSS?",
        "answer": "Position: absolute and position: relative are both CSS properties that control the positioning of an element, but they have different effects. Position: relative positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow, while allowing other elements to flow around it. Position: absolute positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, or the document if no ancestor is positioned. Absolute positioning takes an element out of the normal flow of the document and can cause other elements to overlap with it.",
        "tag": "css"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden in CSS?",
        "answer": "The display: none property removes an element from the flow of the document, so it takes up no space and is not visible. The visibility: hidden property hides an element but still takes up space and affects the layout of the document. In other words, display: none completely removes the element from the page, while visibility: hidden hides the element but still reserves its space.",
        "tag": "css"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between inline and block elements in CSS?",
        "answer": "Inline elements are those that only take up as much width as their content and do not start a new line. Examples of inline elements include <a>, <span>, and <strong>. Block elements, on the other hand, take up the full width available to them and start a new line. Examples of block elements include <div>, <p>, and <h1>. Inline elements can be nested inside block elements, but block elements cannot be nested inside inline elements.",
        "tag": "css"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the z-index property in CSS?",
        "answer": "The z-index property determines the stacking order of elements on a web page. An element with a higher z-index value will appear on top of an element with a lower z-index value. The z-index property only applies to positioned elements (i.e., those with position: relative, position: absolute, or position: fixed).",
        "tag": "css"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between ID and class selectors in CSS?",
        "answer": "ID selectors target a specific HTML element based on its unique ID attribute, using the # symbol. For example, #header { background-color: blue; } would target the element with an ID of 'header'. Class selectors, on the other hand, target one or more HTML elements based on their shared class attribute, using the . symbol. For example, .highlight { background-color: yellow; } would target all elements with a class of 'highlight'. An ID can only be used once on a page, while a class can be used multiple times.",

    },
    {
        "question": "What is VH/VW (viewport height/ viewport width) in CSS?",
        "answer": "VH and VW are CSS units used to measure viewport height and viewport width respectively in percentage form in the responsive design techniques. E.g. If the height of the browser is 1000px, then VH is 1/100 of the height of the viewport that is 1000px*(1/100) = 10px, which is the height of the browser.  The same applies to VW (viewport width).",

    {
        "question": "What are Pseudo classes?",
        "answer": "Pseudo-classes are the type of pseudo-elements that don’t exist in a normal document tree. It allows selecting the regular elements under certain conditions especially when we try to hover over the link; the anchor tags are :link, :visited, :hover, :active, :focus",

    {
        "question": "How is opacity specified in CSS3?",
        "answer": "Opacity is the measure of content transparency. It is measured in the range from 0 to 1. Value 1 means the content is completely opaque. It is not supportable in the internet browser. Also, the 60% of opacity is applicable in the div section where we need to apply the filter property (polyfill) to make it completely opaque.",
        "tag": "css"
    },
    {
        "question": "How does absolute positioning work?",
        "answer": "Absolute positioning is used to place the element which is then removed from the HTML document from the normal workflow without creating any space for the element in the HTML page layout. The element can be positioned respectively to the closest positioned ancestor; otherwise, if the ancestor is not found, the element is placed with respect to the initial container box. The values provided to the top, right, left and bottom determine the final position of the element.",

    {
        "question": "What is the difference between the display: block and display: inline-block properties in CSS?",
        "answer": "The display: block property makes an element a block-level element, which means it takes up the full width of its parent container and creates a new line after it. The display: inline-block property makes an element an inline-level block element, which means it takes up only as much width as necessary and does not create a new line after it. It allows other inline-level elements to be displayed on the same line next to it.",
