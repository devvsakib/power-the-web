                    <b>Yun Sim-deok</b> (Korean: 윤심덕; Hanja: 尹心悳; 25 July 1897 – 4 August 1926) was a Korean singer. She
                    was the
                    country's first professional soprano.
                </p>
                <p>After teaching for one year, Yun went to Japan, becoming the first Korean to study at the Tokyo Music
                    School.
                    In Japan, she met and fell in love with a married English literature student, Kim U-jin (Hangul:
                    김우진), with
                    whom she had an affair.[3] </p>
                <p>
                    Yun was born in Pyongyang in 1897. She studied at the Pyongyang Girls' Middle and High Schools, and
                    graduated from Kyongsong Women's Teaching College in Seoul in 1914. After graduation she became a
                    primary
                    school teacher in Wonju.

        <p>Yun's most famous recording, 1926's "Hymn of Death," is considered the first "popular" (yuhaeng changga)
            Korean song. It was recorded in Osaka by the Japanese Nitto recording company, with Yun's sister
            accompanying her on piano. The song is set to the tune of "Waves of the Danube" by Ion Ivanovici. </p>
